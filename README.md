# PPSTM-DMCS
This branch of the PPSTM code (DMCS: DysonMoldenConstantCurrentSisl) has the ability to perform constant-current STM simulations and work with more TB/DFT packages such as sisl. It is also compatible with quantum chemistry file format generated by MOLDEN, and can perform STM simulations on dyson orbitals calculated from CAS-CI package.
