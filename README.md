# PPSTM-DMCS
DMCS: DysonMoldenConstantCurrentSisl
The PPSTM code with the ability to perform constant-current STM maps and work with more TB/DFT packages such as sisl. It is compatible with quantum chemistry code MOLDEN, and can perform STM simulations on dyson orbitals calculated from CAS-CI package.
